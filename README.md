# Pig Dice Game
## Description
A simple  two player dice game that tests players' luck. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until they either roll a 1 or decide to "hold".
The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the round.

### Built By Denis Githinji

## Rules. 
* When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play
* When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* When a player rolls a 1, their running score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn. They do not accumulate points for the round.
* The player who first scores 100 or more points wins.
